Machine learning has become increasingly prevalent in the real estate industry for predicting house values and providing key indicators for
investors in making informed decisions on the market trends. In this research, by integrating computer science and artificial intelligence (AI),
various machine learning (ML) algorithms and data features were tested to determine which procedures yielded the highest accuracy. Based on
this research, it will assist real estate investors with predictive analytics for the pricing trend and better market segmentations, risk
assessments, demand forecasting and portfolio optimization. The same process can also be applied and tested for the Short Term Rental
(STR) market for Airbnb investors in the current dynamic real estate market. The imported dataset encompasses variables from the dynamic
California housing market, layered with additional geographic parameters. Linear regression, support vector machines with linear, polynomial,
and radial basis function kernels, and deep neural networks were reviewed and tested. To assess the accuracy of the regression models, RMSE
was used as an evaluation metric. Upon analyzing the RMSE results, the SVR with the RBF kernel exhibited the lowest error values compared to
the performance of other models. This indicates the suitability of this model for the regression task and highlights the impact of model
hyperparameter choice on task performance. The exceptional performance of the RBF kernel makes it a valuable candidate for real-world
applications and future house price predictions in the volatile real estate market. These findings lay the foundation for model optimization,
feature engineering, and further investigation into the characteristics of the dataset and alternative model architectures.
